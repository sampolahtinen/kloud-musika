# kloud-muzika

Web based music player for streaming your purchased music collection. Personal motivation is to build a tool for refreshing my memory of the thousands of purchased digital tracks for DJing. 
The important feature will be a time range selector that defines how long a specific track is being played and from which time point onwards. In this way it is easy to shuffle around the library
and remind oneself of all the forgotten gems.

Work in progress..
